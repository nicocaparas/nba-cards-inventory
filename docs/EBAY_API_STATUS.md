## üìå Summary  
This document tracks the current integration status of the eBay API with the NBA Card Inventory project.

## ‚úÖ Progress  

- [x] eBay Developer account created

- [x] OAuth token flow working (Client Credentials & User Auth)  
- [x] eBay Browse API integrated ‚Äî fetches **active listings** for current market prices  

### üî® Marketplace Insights API Integration Plan

- [x] Decided to pursue Marketplace Insights API due to Finding API deprecation
- [ ] Scrape 130point to get card last sold data right away (for personal use only) üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** üîÑ
- [ ] Prepare app for eBay‚Äôs Application Growth Check (compliance, privacy policy, secure redirects, etc.)  
- [ ] Design integration architecture for **sold listings data**  
- [ ] Set up mock API to simulate Marketplace Insights response for frontend testing 

## üöß Known Issues  

### ‚ùó Finding API Deprecation *(Logged: June 11, 2025)*
- **Problem**: Originally planned to use the `findCompletedItems` operation from the Finding API for retrieving sold listings.  
- **Fix**: Finding API is deprecated. Looking into using the [Marketplace Insights API]([https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/commerce/marketplace-insights/overview.html](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/marketplace-insights/static/overview.html
) as an alternative.

### ‚ùó Marketplace Insights Access *(Logged: June 12, 2025)*
- **Problem**: Access to Marketplace Insights requires eBay‚Äôs *Application Growth Check*.  
- **Fix**: 
  - Preparing application for review following all required guidelines (OAuth setup, API compliance, privacy policy, etc.) with the help of a Mock API.  
  - Once the app is production-ready and meets compliance and security requirements, submit a **Growth Check Request** to eBay.
- **Temporary Solution**: Considering scraping 130point or eBay sold listings for **personal, non-commercial** use until API access is approved.
